This software, unofficially titled "Digital Cornell Notes", was designed to automatically format notes as cornell notes,
and save them as low-storage binary files. Saved files retain their formatting, and can be opened by the software. At
this time, a feature is presently in development to export the .note format to other file types in such a way as to retain 
their formatting, but it has not yet been completed. The software is built on Python's TKinter module, and can easily be
compiled for any target machine; however, it has not yet been properly packaged for any major distributions. Several additional
functionalities have been added, including:
 - common keyboard shortcuts for actions, such as ctrl+s and ctrl+o
 - the ability to open .note files directly from the file explorer, without needing to open the program first

This program was written a little bit before the start of my junior year in high school, and saw extensive use during the rest of
my time in high school. A few example .note files have been included here: one in the same directory as the program, and one in
a nested example folder, to demonstrate its ability to open files anywhere in the user's file system.
