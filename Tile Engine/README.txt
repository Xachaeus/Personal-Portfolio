This project was intended to be developed into a larger full-blown
game, but the engine was useful and adaptable enough that I decided
to leave it as its own engine for future projects. The engine can
generate, save, load, and edit tile-based worlds with an arbitrary
number of tile types. It also allows for smooth scrolling through
the tile-based world without stutters or gaps in between individual
tiles, and efficiently displays a large number of tiles.
